  # Canvas Artist
  
  Give the artist instructions to paint a portrait of your choice on a .txt file!
  
  How do you give the artist instructions? Write them on a text file using the following format:
  
  Pen status (1 for pen up, 2 for pen down), direction (N, S, E, W), number of moves, bold status (bold or regular brush strokes), and P to print out the image.
  
  Example:
  2, N, 11, B
  
  2, W, 1
  
  1, S, 1
  
  2, S, 8
  
  1, N, 10
  
  2, W, 1, B
